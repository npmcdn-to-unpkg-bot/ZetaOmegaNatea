              <p class="lead">Of all the parts of a Zon bass, the neck is probably the part you’ll feel most intimate with. We produce some models with composite necks and others with wood necks, but they are not interchangeable. Each has its own sonic and physical characteristics, and we spend a great deal of time optimizing each neck to its specific model.</p>
              <p class="lead">
              Bolt-on necks are just that, bolted to the body using screws. Our design features a deep inset heel, which allows more surface area of the neck to come into contact with the body. This technique means greater neck-to-body coupling for better sound and vibrational transmission. The deep inset heel also prevents side-to-side neck shift, common with many other traditional bolt-on designs.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Set-in or glue-on necks are the means of attaching a neck to the body using a dovetail joint. Here the body is routed with a pocket to accommodate a “tongue,” or “dovetail,” on the neck. The two interlock and are held together with a specially formulated aerospace epoxy, engineered to have very high shear strength, making the neck and body impossible to separate. Because of this design, the neck and body vibrate as an integral piece, providing superior sound and vibrational transmission. After the neck and body are glued together, the transitional area between the two is hand-sculpted for playing comfort and easy access to the upper frets.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
              When viewing the heel area of our bass with a set-in neck, many people mistakenly think the design is a neck-through. A neck-though design is one where the neck runs through the entire center length of the body. This method is NOT utilized on any of our models. The tone generated by a neck-through composite design lacks the warmth and character we choose to have in our instruments. Another reason for not using this design is that it doesn’t allow us the same freedom in voicing the instrument, because the composite center that runs through the body affects the way the wood “speaks.”
              </p>
              <h3>Composite Necks</h3>
              <p class="lead">
              The object of using composites for our necks is to integrate the stability and performance of these materials in a manner that enhances the tonal characteristics, reliability, and consistency of our basses, without losing the warmth and personality.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
              Our basses’ necks are fabricated in our Redwood City, California, facility. The base material is carbon fiber, developed for the aerospace industry. Carbon fiber is rayon extruded under extreme heat and pressure, a process that changes its molecular structure on a subatomic level. Engineered to have the highest strength-to-weight ratio possible (it’s six times stronger than steel), it also has the highest coefficient of stiffness and the lowest thermal coefficient, offering great stability and strength under compression, as well as tension.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
              However, carbon fiber isn’t the only material we employ. Our proprietary “recipe” incorporates wood and other materials, which allows us to tune the necks so every instrument retains that organic and musical earthiness so pleasingly familiar to the ear.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Because the neck has a “flatter” frequency response, it has less effect on coloring the wood body’s tone, therefore letting its true voice come through. With the neck material being so dense, the bass is very “live” and responsive. This condition is a function of a faster attack whereby the note comes into focus almost immediately and then swells with richness. Consequently, the tone has more clarity and the notes exhibit improved detail, projection, sustain, and evenness in volume, all across the fingerboard. This definition is particularly beneficial in lowered tunings, where the notes are usually lost or muddy. Instead, lowered tunings retain their clarity and don’t hide in the mix of the other instruments.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
              While the concept of using this material for a neck may seem unfamiliar, the feel of our necks is not. Contoured after some of the classic shapes we’ve come to know and love, the profile of our necks feels very natural to the hand and all of them are extremely comfortable and easy to play. The action is fast and smooth, making them suitable for any playing technique.
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                Some models employ a bolt-on neck design (Sonus), while others employ a set-in, glue-on design (Legacy). Neither design is “better”; they just perform differently by nature of the manner in which the neck is attached to the body. Bolt-on necks exhibit a punchier tone, while set-in necks are more “open” sounding. Both designs allow us greater freedom in voicing the instrument, because they allow the body wood to speak for itself without being colored. Graphite string nuts are installed for the string-to-string evenness of tone and durability they offer.
              </p>

                Fingerboards On Composite Necks
              </h3>
              <p class="lead">
                A unique material we call phenowood, it was developed in the 1950’s and has been used for many applications from aircraft to cutlery. Truth is, phenowood complements the expansion and contraction coefficients of our composite neck nicely. Not only that, but it makes for a warm and earthy (organic) sounding fingerboard. Utilizing an advanced process, veneers of maple or birch dyed black are impregnated with a phenolic, thermosetting resin that lines the wood’s cell walls. The “sandwich” of these treated hardwoods starts out about 3” tall. It is then compressed under intense heat and pressure to fuse into a solid, homogeneous sheet of material with a final thickness of 1/4”. Because the cell walls are coated with this now-cured resin, the material becomes highly resistant to moisture and humidity. Despite the impregnated resin, the physical and tonal qualities of the phenowood board are very similar to that of a traditional wooden fingerboard. The main difference that the phenowood board is far more stable.
